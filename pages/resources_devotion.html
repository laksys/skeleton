<h3>Consciousness Meditation</h3>

<p>These days, more and more people are interested in learning meditation. Many of us have a surface level idea of what meditation is. We know the word meditation. We also come across various techniques to perform meditation. Some same meditation is thoughtless, and some say that meditation is all about experience.</p>

<h3>What is Meditation?</h3>

<p>Meditation has to do with something about the mind. The mind always depends upon the information gathered by the five sensory perceptions. The mind is a processor of information that the sensory perceptions receive. It processes this information and as a result we develop likes and dislikes. The mind cannot conclude what its likes and dislikes are. The mind is always in a oscillation like a pendulum. To bring the mind to stillness, we need a certain practice. That practice is meditation.</p>

<p>How do we bring about the mind that is always wavering to a static state of being? Is it really possible to be thoughtless? Being in thoughtless state does not mean having stillness of mind. The mind cannot be in a static position because once you start thinking that you should not have any thoughts, or that you don't have a thought, that in itself is a thought. That way, thoughtlessness does not seem possible. So what is possible in meditation? The nature of the mind is to think constantly. One thought leads to another. At once, the mind is capable of having multiple thoughts. The mind can think of the minute details. Even though the mind is not capable of thinking about all things simultaneously, it jumps from one thought to the next within a fraction of a second. Because of this, the mind gets cluttered resulting in confusion.</p>

<p>The first attempt in meditation is to have a one thought. Only one thought. If at all another thought arises spontaneously, let us try to increase the duration between two thoughts. Try to pull your mind towards having one thought. This is called concentration meditation.</p>

<p>We need an object for meditation. Without an object, meditation is impossible, because in this case, there is duality. In this mental transaction there is duality. One is the meditator and the other in what is being meditated upon. If I am to meditate upon the image of a deity, that is objectified. The image is the objectification of the deity. Now I focus on the image of the deity and the attributes of that deity. It may be the grace of the deity, it may be mercy or even the nature of the deity. I can meditate upon various attributes pertaining to the a deity. So, for any meditation, one requires an object or objectification.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is another type of meditation for informed people. That is known as contemplation meditation. When I study Vedanta under the lotus feet of a</p>

<p>Guru, I come to realisation that I am not the mind, I am not this body, I am not the sensory perceptions; I am pure consciousness. Whatever I perceive as this world or as reality is indeed false, it is unreal - a mere illusion. I am the self.</p>

<p>To own up to this concept, I need repetitive contemplation on this affirmation. To remove all doubts, I need to contemplate. When I meditate upon the self, the duality between the meditator and what is being meditated upon vanishes. There is no two but one cause I am the self. So I meditate upon me. There is no discrimination between the meditator and what is being meditated upon. This means to own up. Owning up to the self. This is called a contemplative meditation and and the subject matter of this type of meditation is consciousness which is 'I am'. I am pure consciousness is going to be the contemplation in my contemplative meditation. This will not be possible for an uniformed person about this truth as prescribed by the holy scriptures. Once you become informed with the grace of the Guru and start enquiring about who you truly are, then it becomes possible for you to meditate upon that knowledge. Being simply seated and asking yourself 'who am I?' will not help you attain realisation. The aim of this form of meditation is self-realization.</p>
