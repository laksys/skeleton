<h2>RESOURCES - VEDANTA</h2>

<p>Vedanta is the study of Brahman - the Self. By studying Vedanta, one attains Brahmajnana - knowledge of the Self. Vedanta enlightens the seeker of Existence, Consciousness and Completeness. Vedanta helps us in overcoming our karma which is the cause of all sufferings and happenings that traps us within a monotonous living and refrains us from attaining Self- realization.</p>

<p>We are desperately and constantly on a search without knowing what it is that we are truly seeking. The mind oscillates like a pendulum and what makes us feel complete at an instant does not give us permanent contentment. We fulfill a specific desire and that gives a momentous joy. We find ourselves chasing after another goal or object the very next moment. The quest is unceasing. We associate our happiness and feeling of completeness with material possessions and validity from others. Over time and with experience, we may come to understand that this is a false pursuit and that it is incessant. That is when an individual starts turning his/her thoughts inward. By then, youth and age would have passed by. When one is open to and on the path of Self-Discovery, that individual will not fall prey to the false pretexts of life that the society has conditioned us into perceiving. We come to terms with reality and the truth about the Self, allowing us for a peaceful and successful living. We would have complete control over our actions and the outcomes. This way, we stop acquiring further karma. We experience freedom.</p>

<p>With Vedanta, you will realize that what you are seeking is already innate. You are seeking the Self. You are whole and complete.The Self is no different from the Divine. The Self is non-dual in nature. When non-duality is realized, one becomes the embodiment of Compassion. You start viewing all that exists in the same light that you regard yourself. There is no discrimination between the Self, others and the Divine. This knowledge gives liberation.</p>

<p>Vedanta can only be taught by a Guru who has studied, understood and lives in accordance to the Vedantic scriptures. A Guru is an individual who has realized that the Self and Divine are one. A Guru is full of compassion and always ready to pass on this knowledge to a seeker regardless of caste, creed or religion.</p>

<p>The Guru's life is looked upon for inspiration and guidance by which a Student shall live by. There is no greater role model than the Guru.</p>
