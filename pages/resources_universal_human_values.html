<h2>RESOURCES - UNIVERSAL HUMAN VALUES</h2>

<p>Universal Human Values are vital in leading a peaceful life. Every individual should vow to consciously stand by and act according to virtue. Possessing moral traits leads one to triumphant success in all aspects of life.</p>

<p>Everyone has a fundamental idea of what is considered good and bad. We are aware of the implications of our actions. Yet due to various circumstances, we are forced to succumb to our situation and let go of our values. We knowingly avoid abiding by our morale and principles at times despite knowing the implications.</p>

<p>Swamiji teaches Universal Human Values through five virtues: Truth, Righteousness, Peace, Love and Non-violence. In order to live a virtuous life, we have to become aware. Awareness comes when one becomes conscious from within.</p>

<h3>Unfolding Consciousness</h3>

<p>To lead a life of consciousness, one should first understand cause and effect. We are responsible for our actions. Thus, we are also responsible for the resulting outcome of our actions. With this acceptance, we will be able to analyze and learn from our experiences. Over time, our experiences will give us the knowledge to distinguish between what is permanent and the impermanent.</p>

<p>Once we develop this cognition, we become conscious mentally, physically and emotionally. This sets the fundamentals for living a life of virtue.</p>

<h3>Truth</h3>

<p>Truth is a value that is to be seeked from within. It does not translate to external factualities. Truth is the certainty of the Self. Truth is the knowledge and true nature of the Self. With proper guidance, we refrain from believing that we are the body or our mind. It helps us gain control over our actions. This gives rise to the quest for knowledge and study of oneself.</p>

<h3>Righteousness</h3>

<p>The quality of being Righteous develops when we come to terms with the truth - nature of the Self. Self-realization leads an individual towards becoming prudent. With this wisdom, we can overcome desire, greed and anger which is the cause of disharmony and destruction of the Self and society. These three qualities are the cause of all evil deeds committed by mankind. With consciousness, we can defeat our inner enemies and live a life of Righteousness.</p>

<h3>Peace</h3>

<p>The Human Value of Peace exists with each and everyone of us. Through proper education and guidance, this true nature of the Self can be unleashed. Through conscious living, an individual will be able to move away from the fire of desire by realization of the Divine and into peacefulness. Peace allows us to accept life as it is, letting go of our negative traits. Peace is the normality of mind and a priceless possession of man. Peace allows one to be self content. This inturn leads one towards infinite love.</p>

<h3>Love</h3>

<p>Love plays a paramount importance in establishing the other four Human Values. When we start feeling pure love, we feel at peace with ourselves and our surroundings.</p>

<p>Man has been conditioned to become a social being and has been made to think that he/she cannot survive without contact and bond with another individual. We are made to think that love is a bond which connects individual hearts. However, in reality, unconditional love exists with us naturally. Man is the embodiment of love.</p>

<p>When we realize the existence of love internally, we automatically stop depending on another for a feeling of adequacy or validation. We become love.</p>

<h3>Non-violence</h3>

<p>Violence is the outcome of illiteracy of man. Illiteracy here means unawareness of the inner truth of consciousness. Violence has seemed to become the solution to various problems but it is the beginning of great destruction for humanity. The realization of the fundamental 'Atmic Unity' and oneness with God leads to non-violence. If awareness of kinship is persistent within each individual, no man will knowingly cause pain of distress to another.</p>
