<h2>RESOURCES - SRI VIDYA MEDITATION </h2>

<h3>Sri Vidya Meditation</h3>

<p>'Sri' means auspicious and 'Vidya' means knowledge. Sri Vidya is auspicious knowledge. True wealth is indeed knowledge. Only knowledge gives liberation.</p>

<p>Sri Vidya is a branch within the Shakta tradition where the Goddess is regarded as the Supreme manifestation of the Divine.</p>

<p>The practice of Sri Vidya leads to ultimate truth - realization of the Self. It helps connect with oneself, understand and progress towards growth. Sri Vidya is a form of kundalini yoga. By incorporating it's practice into daily life, purification of mind and body takes place.</p>

<p>All that exists is regarded as the play of the Mother Goddess in the Shakta tradition. The ultimate reality is infinite consciousness.</p>

<p>We associate our existence with our mind and body. However, the inner self, full of compassion towards all that exists, is hidden within ourselves. Our karma prevents us from understanding the truth about the nature of the Self. This false perception of the mind-body complex can be overcome through the practice of Sri Vidya.</p>

<p>Sri Vidya has been kept a secret and it has been passed on from Guru to Shishya (disciple) since time immemorial. The Guru is considered the physical manifestation of the Goddess herself. Complete surrender to the Guru is key in any tradition within Hinduism. By surrendering to the Guru, one receives the blessings of infinite deities and the entire Guru lineage. Only the grace of a Guru can change one's destiny.</p>

<p>In Sri Vidya, mantras play a primary role. The mantras consist of sacred syllables. These mantras are only activated when initiation from a Guru is received. Merely learning them from books or other sources will not give the necessary results to the seeker.</p>

<p>In Sri Vidya Meditation, we focus on each chakra within the human body. We aim to cleanse, energize and stabilize each chakra. By strengthening the weaker chakras, we can overcome various shortcomings in our lives including past traumas, ailments, problems related to finances, work, etc.</p>

<p>Over time, with regular practice, purification of the mind and body takes place. With Sri Vidya we can eliminate all external factors that hinder with our progress. This will allow us to first connect with ourselves. When we are confident about who we truly are, we can pursue the ultimate knowledge. This takes us towards Vedanta.</p>

<p>In the Sri Vidya realm, several schools and practices exist and the methodology varies for each tradition. Swamiji propagates Samayachara Sri Vidya, the right handed path.</p>

<p>In Samayachara Sri Vidya, thoughts and rituals are turned inwards. It is a pure form of practicing Sri Vidya. It is not complicated and allows for easy practice.</p>
