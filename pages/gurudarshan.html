<h3>Program</h3>

<p>The Guru Darshan workshop is a program designed by Swamiji to help individuals connect with themselves, understand their problems and solve them.</p>

<p>In the present age, we hardly have time for ourselves. We are stuck between our jobs, responsibilities and relationships. We wait for an opportunity to escape reality and divert our minds. We hardly turn our thoughts inward. We dance along to the music called life. By the time we start understanding life, the music is already over. We often have this feeling of inadequacy that leaves us with insecurity.</p>

<p>Confidence is key for success. We need to believe in ourselves. For that, we first need to discover and understand who we are. We need to find the true purpose of life. When we feel sufficient, we will not turn to external factors for security. We already hold the solution to all of our problems. We are complete as we are. Through the grace of a Guru, this realization is possible!</p>

<p>Guru Darshan is your opportunity to connect with Swamiji and unleash your infinite potential from within.</p>
